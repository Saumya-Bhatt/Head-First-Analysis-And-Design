### 1. Introduction to OOA&D - Rick's Guitar Shop

* First get requirements from customer and make a working model
* Use OO concepts to make it re-useable and flexible
* Delegate functionalities to make it maintainable

### 2. Getting customer requirements - Doug's Dog Doors

* First get the list of requirements from the customer
* From that prepare the usecases. Each usecase must achieve a singular goal and should have 3 properties.
* Once usecases are defined, work on refining the requirements.
* Keep in mind the happy and the alternate paths, both of which should lead to the same end goal.
* Single usecase can have multiple scenarios as long as they have same end point.

2.1 [Defining the problem](https://github.com/Saumya-Bhatt/Head-First-Analysis-And-Design/tree/2.1-dougs-dog-doors) <br>
2.2 [Refining solution according after listening to requirements](https://github.com/Saumya-Bhatt/Head-First-Analysis-And-Design/tree/2.2-dougs-dog-doors) <br>
2.3 [Requirements updated. Update the usecase](https://github.com/Saumya-Bhatt/Head-First-Analysis-And-Design/tree/2.3-dougs-dog-door) <br>
2.4 [Encapsulating parts that might change](https://github.com/Saumya-Bhatt/Head-First-Analysis-And-Design/tree/2.4-dougs-dog-doors)

* Perform a **textual analysis** on your usecase to identify which nouns are objects and the verbs being the methods the objects should implement.
* Update the class diagrams with associations.
* Identify which flow could be a different usecase on its own.
