### 2. Getting customer requirements - Doug's Dog Doors

* Firs get the list of requirements from the customer
* From that prepare the usecases. Each usecase must achieve a singular goal and should have 3 properties.
* Once usecases are defined, work on refining the requirements.
* Keep in mind the happy and the alternate paths, both of which should lead to the same end goal.
* Single usecase can have multiple scenarios as long as they have same end point.
